As a defense type, Armor is the amount you reduce damage taken from *most* attacks. To compute your Armor, first check what kind of armor you wear.

Armor is divided into three types. Heavier armor covers more of your body and provides more protection, but in turn also restricts your movement.
### Unarmored
While unarmored, your base Armor is equal to your `Dexterity` score.
### Light Armor
While wearing light armor, your base Armor is `Dexterity + 2`, but your base move speed is reduced by 5 feet.
### Medium Armor
While wearing medium armor, your base Armor is `Dexterity (max 2) + 4`, but your base move speed is reduced by 10 feet.
### Heavy Armor
You have **Disadvantage** on *Stealth* checks while wearing heavy armor. 

While wearing heavy armor, your base Armor is `7`, but your base move speed is reduced by 15 feet.
### Armor Fit
The armor you start with from your background or class, as well as armor you purchase at a vendor, will be fitted to your size and shape. In contrast, armor looted from dank dungeons or corpses unlikely to fit you well. 

Wearing armor that is not well-fitted imposes disadvantage on all Attack rolls, as well as Ability checks using Strength or Dexterity. 

The exception to this is magical armor, which will typically change its shape to fit its wearer.
