#### Basic Attack
Sometimes, the rules will allow you to make a Basic Attack. All classes have access to a Basic Weapon Attack, which deals `2d6 + Strength/Dexterity (your choice) @ Armor` damage. Your class might also give you an alternative Basic Attack option. 

When you make a Basic Attack **outside of your turn**, you can't modify/replace it with a class feature like the Tactician's Maneuvers, or the Rogue's Exploits. (*These class features also explicitly mention they can replace a weapon attack only on your turn*) 
#### Opportunity Attacks
When you have a melee Basic Attack available and a creature leaves its range through voluntary movement, they provoke an **Opportunity Attack** from you. You can spend your **reaction** to make the Basic Attack against them before they leave your range.
#### Concentration
Sometimes an ability will have its duration listed with (**Concentration**). That means the effect only lasts as long as you **Concentrate** on it. You can **Concentrate** on only one effect at a time. Each time you take damage while Concentrating, you must make a Constitution check with DC 8 or half the damage you took, whichever is higher. If you take damage while **vulnerable**, you have disadvantage on the Constitution check. On a failure, you lose **Concentration** and the effect ends.
#### Knockback
When an ability allows you to **Knockback** an enemy, you push them _directly away from you_. If you push them along a diagonal, their movement follows [[#The Diagonal Rule|The Diagonal Rule]] - for example, if they are pushed 15 feet, the move 2 squares diagonally, but if they are pushed either 5 or 10 feet, they move just one square diagonally.
#### Pushing Enemies into Obstacles
If you push an enemy into an obstacle (which might be an object, terrain, or another creature), they take damage and deal damage to the obstacle equal to the remaining number of 5 foot squares left in the push. If this damage destroys the obstacle, any remaining movement is continued past it.

*Example: Barry the Barbarian uses a Push bonus action to Knockback an Orc 15 feet. The Orc immediately hits a chair in the way, which deals 1 damage to the Orc and chair, destroying the chair. The Orc then travels the remaining 10 feet through the now-destroyed chair.*

#### The Diagonal Rule
Diagonal squares alternate between 5 feet apart and 10 feet apart for any ability that cares about distance.

*Example: Tav has 25 feet of speed, and wants to move diagonally as far as he'll go; he will spend 5 feet of movement to move to a square that is diagonally adjacent to his current one, and then 10 feet to move to the next diagonally adjacent square. He can spend another 5 feet to move diagonally again, but this leaves him with only 5 feet of movement - he cannot move another diagonal square.*
