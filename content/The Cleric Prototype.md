Clerics have highly varying abilities depending on their domain. This prototype Cleric is a champion of a fiery religion - while the Cleric is normally a very Supportive class, this subclass leans somewhat into a Striker role
#### Duality
The Gods vary widely in powers, personality, and interest in mortal affairs. One trait, they all share - fickle. They provide deliverance with one stroke of the wrist, and lay waste with the next. You have 2 resources: <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Virtue</font> and <font style="color:Tomato">Wrath</font>, which you use to invoke divine powers. At the start of your turn, roll a d6: if the result is even, you gain that much <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Virtue</font>; if it's odd, you gain that much <font style="color:Tomato">Wrath</font>
#### Channel Divinity
Few prayers earn the attention of the divine, yet your faith ensures you never fall on deaf ears.  As an action, you can appeal to your patron saint or diety; roll 1d6 and gain <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Virtue</font> or <font style="color:Tomato">Wrath</font> as per your Duality feature.

You then gain a benefit based on the relative balance of <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Virtue</font> and <font style="color:Tomato">Wrath</font> you are holding.

#### Invocations
Invocations are small rotes and rituals which allow you to channel divine power into repeatable, predictable effects. If an invocation is labeled as a *Weapon Attack*, it can replace one *weapon attack* on your turn (and itself is a *weapon attack*). 
##### Pious Strike
Signature Invocation  -- *A Signature Invocation costs no resources, but only one can be used per turn* 
*Melee Weapon Attack*  
Damage: `2d6 + Strength @ Armor` -- _Subtract the target’s Armor defense from the damage listed_  
*Effect:* Generates your choice of <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">2 Virtue</font> or <font style="color:Tomato">2 Wrath</font> -- *You get this Effect any time you use this Invocation, even if no damage was dealt*
##### Inflame
Costs <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">2 Virtue</font>  
Targets yourself and one ally within 25 feet  
*Effect:* The target has their resolve bolstered; they gain `1d8 + your Wisdom` stamina.    Alternatively, they can choose to reject the restoration and instead have their weapon ignited, empowering their next attack with `1d8 + your Wisdom` additional Fire damage. If they opt to inflame their weapon, you gain <font style="color:Tomato">1 Wrath</font>.  
##### Surge Forth, o Flame 
Costs <font style="color:Tomato">3 Wrath</font>   
Targets all creatures in a 15 foot cone  
Damage: `2d6 + Wisdom @ Dexterity` Fire  
*Effect on Damage:* You can spend an additional <font style="color:Tomato">X Wrath</font> to inflict **Burning (X)** on them. -- *You get this Effect only on targets which took damage from the Invocation*  
##### Eruption Seal
Costs <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">2 Virtue</font>, <font style="color:Tomato">4 Wrath</font>  
*Melee Weapon Attack*  
Damage: `2d6 + Strength @ Armor`  
*Effect*: The struck target is marked with an Eruption Seal; until combat ends **([[Concentration]])**, their armor cracks, glowing with red-hot energy that seems ready to burst, while attacks against them generate showers of sparks.   
After an attack (excluding this one) deals damage to the target, roll 1d6; on a 1-5, the creature takes that much additional fire damage. On a 6, the seal explodes - the target and all creatures within 5 feet of them take `3d8 @ Armor` Fire damage. You can spend <font style="color:Tomato">2 Wrath</font> when rolling to force a 6 on the roll. The seal also explodes if the target is reduced to 0 health. If you lose concentration or willingly end the Invocation, the seal disappears without exploding.
