You have proficiency with the following skills:
*Stealth, Acrobatics, Sleight-of-Hand, Perception, Deception*
#### Lucky
A Rogue is defined by their knack to succeed where by all rights they ought to fail. 

You have a resource called <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Luck</font>, which you can spend on your Rogue features. You gain <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">1 Luck</font> at the start of each of your turns; you also gain <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">1 Luck</font> when you crit on a roll, or when an attack misses you (its damage is reduced to zero).

There is no limit on how much <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Luck</font> you can have, but it resets to 0 when you take a short or long rest.
#### Resourceful
A *good* Rogue also knows that sometimes you have to tip the scales a bit and make your own luck. Advantage dice are d6s instead of d4s when you use them. 6's on advantage dice can contribute towards a critical success *(e.g. rolling 3 and 6 on your core 2d6 roll, you can still crit if one of your advantage dice comes up 6)*
#### Switcheroo
As a bonus action, you can swap positions with a willing ally, and then move up to your speed. When you are hit with a weapon attack, you can spend <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">1 Luck</font> and use your **reaction** to swap positions with a willing ally; they are hit by the attack instead. After switching positions as a **reaction**, you can move up to 15 feet only.
#### Supreme Sneak
Anyone can be stealthy outside of combat (or at least can try), but once combat has begun, foes are already aware of your presence. As a Rogue, you are nonetheless able to take advantage of momentary lapses in tracking to disappear and strike from unexpected approaches.

You have access to a unique bonus action: **Disappear**. You can use this bonus action only when you are fully obscured from your foes - they don‚Äôt have line of sight on you, or are incapacitated. Using **Disappear** grants you the **Unexpected** condition, as well as allowing you to spend movement up to half your speed.

You can move up to 5 feet while continuously visible (in the line of sight of a foe) without losing the **Unexpected** condition. 

You can extend this distance restriction by moving in an appropriately unexpected way, which will likely require an ability check.¬†For example, jumping off a raised terrace and swinging on a chandelier to cover a greater distance might extend the distance to however far you can swing. If a foe is clearly engaged with one of your allies, just approaching from the other way might qualify as unexpected movement. The DM has ultimate discretion on which movements lose the **Unexpected** condition and which don‚Äôt.

You also lose the **Unexpected** condition if you start or end your turn while visible to a foe.

Attacking a creature while **Unexpected** always ends the condition, but grants **Advantage** for the attack and grants you <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">1 Luck</font>.
#### Exploit Chaos
The battlefield is a chaotic place, and you thrive in pandemonium. When you make a *weapon attack* on your turn, you can replace it with an Exploit. You know a number of Exploits, and learn additional exploits at certain levels. For this prototype, you know the following Exploits:
##### Opportunism
Signature Exploit - *A Signature Exploit costs no resources, but only one can be used per turn*  
*Damage:* `2d6 + Dexterity @ Armor`  --¬†_Subtract the target‚Äôs Armor defense from the damage listed_  
*Effect:* If you have **Advantage** on the attack, you deal additional damage equal to your current <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Luck</font>.  
##### Diving Strike
Costs <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">1 Luck</font>
*Restriction:* When a creature is within 5 feet horizontally and 5 feet lower than you (+5 feet for each size category the creature is larger than you), you can drop down on them and make this special melee weapon attack against it. The horizontal range limit increases by 5 feet for each additional 5 feet of vertical distance between you and the target.
*Damage:* `2d6 + Dexterity @ Armor`  
*Effect:* Take fall damage as though you fell 30 less feet than you did. You gain **Advantage** on the attack, and land on an adjacent empty square to the creature.
*Effect on damage:* The creature is knocked prone if it's your size or smaller; if it's larger, you can [[Actions#üßóClimb / üèäSwim|climb]] the creature instead of landing adjacent to it.
##### Coup de Grace
Costs <font style="color:PaleGoldenRod">2X Luck</font>
*Restriction:* Target must be **vulnerable**  
*Damage:* `2d6 + Dexterity @ Armor`  
*Effect:* This attack has **Advantage (*X*)**
