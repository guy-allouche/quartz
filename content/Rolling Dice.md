### Ability Checks
When making an ability check, roll 2d6 and add the relevant ability score to form your total. Compare this total against the DC or competing roll to determine success. For DC's, meeting them constitutes a success; for competing rolls, the person who *initiated* the competing check wins on a tie. The DM has ultimate discretion on who initiated an Ability Check.
#### Skill Checks 
Some ability checks are also skill checks, meaning the check has an associated [[skill]]. If you have proficiency in that skill, you gain **1 Advantage** for each level of proficiency you have in that skill.

Often, a skill check will only be labeled with its associated skill, no ability. In these cases, you add the default ability for that skill, unless the DM explicitly asks for a different one.
###### Sharing is Caring
When you make a skill check with proficiency, you can donate any **Advantage** dice you add to your roll to an ally, if they are making the same check.

*Example: Richard the Rogue's party is trying to sneak into a cave, past a sleeping Giant. Richard makes a Stealth Check, rolling 2d6 and adding his Dexterity (because Dexterity is the default ability for Stealth). Instead of rolling his **Advantage** die himself, Richard donates it to Barry, since Barry's Dexterity is rather lacking.*
### Attack Rolls
In TnT, you don't separately roll to hit and to deal damage. When you make an attack using an ability, you roll 2d6 and add your corresponding ability bonus - this is the damage your attack deals. Attacks will always target some kind of defense; your target will reduce the damage they take by their bonus for that defense.

*Example: Tav the Tactician makes a basic attack with his longsword against a Goblin. He uses Strength for his basic attacks, so he'll roll 2d6 and add his +3 Strength bonus, for a total of 10. His basic longsword attack targets Armor, so the Goblin will reduce the attack's damage by his +4 Armor bonus, taking 6 damage*

If your attack's damage is reduced to 0, you miss, leaving you open to a [[counter]].

### Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes when making an ability check or attack, the odds are stacked with or against you. This is represented with **Advantage** and **Disadvantage**. 

Rolling with **Advantage** means you roll an additional **Advantage die**, a 1d4, and add it to your total. Multiple sources of Advantage can stack - having Advantage from two sources, denoted as **Advantage(2)**, allows you to add 2 Advantage dice to your roll.

**Disadvantage** functions exactly the same, except that you *subtract* Disadvantage dice from your total. If you would roll with both Advantage and Disadvantage, they cancel each other out one-to-one.

*Example: Barry the Barbarian kicks the door down into a dark hut, and rushes at the nearest Goblin, who was just startled out of a nice nap. 

*When Barry makes an attack against the goblin, he decides to use his Reckless Attack feature, giving him Advantage. He also has Advantage because the goblin is still prone, giving him Advantage(2). Finally, he has Disadvantage because the room is only dimly lit by the moon through the broken doorway; Barry can't see as well in the dark, while the Goblin sees clearly thanks to their darkvision.*

*The 1 Disadvantage cancels out one 1 Advantage, meaning Barry will add just one 1d4 Advantage die to his attack roll.*
### Critical Success
When you make an attack roll or ability check and get double 6's on the core 2d6 roll, you critically succeed. Add up the total for the roll, then take all dice with 6's on them and roll these again - add this sum to your roll total, before adding static modifiers.
##### Variant: Exploding Crits
With this variant rule, after you re-roll all 6's to add to your total on a critical hit, the new rolls can crit again; continue re-rolling 6's and adding the results to your total until the remaining d6's don't form a crit (double 6's)
### Variant: Defense Rolls
With this variant, only players roll for attacks, regardless of who is attacking who. When a creature makes an attack against you, *you roll* 2d6 and add your defense bonus for whatever the attack is targeting (for most attacks, this is your Armor bonus); subtract the total from the attack's static damage amount.

If you reduce the attack's damage to 0, it misses you, and you can use a *counter* ability - you'll get at least one *counter* ability from your class.

*Example: Tired of being bullied, one Goblin attacks Tav. The Goblin has a static pre-mitigitation damage for their shortsword attack of 16 ([[Dice Math#Inverting who rolls |14 static modifier]] + the Goblin's Dexterity bonus of 2); Tav rolls 2d6 and adds his +5 Armor bonus, getting 5 + 6 + 5 for a total of 16. This reduces the attack's damage to 0, so Tav is able to use his Tactical Counter ability against the goblin.*
