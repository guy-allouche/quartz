#### Ability Scores and Skills
For this prototype, your ability scores are:

| Strength | Dexterity | Constitution | Intelligence | Wisdom | Charisma |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|3|1|2|3|0|2|

You have 13 Health, and 13 Stamina.

Attacks target one of your Defenses; reduce that Defense's score from the attack's damage. Your Defenses are

| Armor | Strength | Dexterity | Constitution | Intelligence | Wisdom | Charisma |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7 (Heavy Armor)|7|3|4|7|2|4|

Because you wear Heavy Armor, your movement speed is 25 feet, and you have disadvantage on *Stealth* checks.

You have proficiency with the following skills:
*Initiative, Athletics, Investigation, Knowledge (Monsters), Survival*
#### Focus
As battle rages on, you do not become disoriented and confused, or anxious and unsure; instead, you grow more focused and sharpen your eyes and mind. 

You have a resource called <font style="color:LightBlue">Focus</font>, which you can spend to execute more complex and powerful maneuvers. You gain <font style="color:LightBlue">1 Focus</font> at the start of each of your turns; you also gain <font style="color:LightBlue">1 Focus</font> when:

- You deal damage to a hostile creature with an attack
- An ally deals (additional) damage to a hostile creature as a result of one of your Tactician features

A single attack can generate at most <font style="color:LightBlue">1 Focus</font>, even if it damages multiple enemies.

There is no limit on how much <font style="color:LightBlue">Focus</font> you can have, but it resets to 0 if you take a short or long rest.
#### Tactical Counter
When a foe misses you with an attack (you reduce its damage to zero), you may **counter** (no reaction needed) dealing weapon damage equal to your Intelligence (no defense).
#### Strategize
It pays to be prepared. If you've had at least 1 minute to survey the area a combat takes place in, you start identifying advantageous positions and putting together strategies to improve your odds of success. 
When you fulfill this requirement and combat begins, you can identify a tactically relevant feature of the terrain; if you do, you and any allies that can hear you have advantage on their first roll this combat. 
#### Parry
You are a master at warding off the deadliest of blows. When you or an ally within 5 feet are attacked, you **spend your reaction** to grant the target +3 armor for this attack; if you use this ability on an ally, gain <font style="color:LightBlue">1 Focus</font>.
#### Battle Master 
You use tactics to control the shifting tide of battle. When you make a *Weapon Attack* on your turn, you can replace it with a Maneuver. You know a set of Maneuvers, and learn additional Maneuvers at certain levels. For this prototype, you know all of the following Maneuvers:
##### Advancing Strike
Signature Maneuver  -- *A Signature Maneuver costs no resources, but only one can be used per turn*  
Damage: `2d6 + Strength @ Armor` -- *Subtract the target's Armor defense from the damage listed*  
*Effect:* An ally of your choice can move 10 feet, plus another 10 feet per <font style="color:LightBlue">1 Focus</font> spent, up to their speed.  
##### Leading Strike
Signature Maneuver  
Damage: `2d6 + Intelligence @ Armor`   
*On damage effect:* The next attack against the target has **Advantage**  
##### Double Trouble
Costs <font style="color:LightBlue">4 Focus</font>  
Damage: `2d6 + Intelligence @ Armor`  
*Effect:* An ally within 5 feet can make a [[Basic Attack]] against the target.
##### Forward!
Costs <font style="color:LightBlue">8 Focus</font>  
Damage: `2d6 + Strength @ Armor`  
*Effect:* Each ally you target within 30 feet can either move 15 feet or [[Knockback]] an adjacent enemy 15 feet.
