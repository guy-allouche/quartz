A psionic caster class. Replaces the Sorcerer 
#### Psionic Talents
You have psionic powers that can manifest themselves through different talents. For this Prototype, you have powers from the Telekinetics and Telepathy categories.
##### Basic Telepathy
You can telepathically communicate with any creature you can see within 60 feet. When communicating this way, you can use a language you know, but you can also project simple images, feelings, or ideas. More communicating more complex ideas may require an ability check, at the DM's discretion.
##### Basic Telekinetics
You can manipulate objects through space with your mind. You can use your mind to freely move light, unattended objects (objects you could comfortably move with one hand) that you can see within 25 feet. If an object is heavier than this or a creature is attending to it, attempting to telekinetically move it will require an ability check; the DM has discretion over whether to call for a check and what the DC is.
#### Strain
While your abilities come naturally to you, non-trivial uses of psionic powers take a toll on your body. Your more powerful abilities generate **Strain**.
