It's time to roll dice and kick ass. In TnT, combat is supposed to be highly collaboration, team based. Because of this, its turn based combat works a little differently from 5e.
#### Side Based Combat
Instead of each character acting on their own initiative, each side (the players and the villains) takes turns allowing one of their members to act - once they do, they can't again this round. Once all members of each side have acted, the next round starts.
##### Who goes first?
One side will have the first turn in all rounds of combat. If one side is [[#Surprise|surprised]] at the start of combat, the other side goes first. If neither side is surprised, determine who goes first by an initiative roll: both sides send whomever they want to go first, to perform competing Initiative checks (in TnT, [[Skills#Initiative | Initiative is a skill you can be proficient in]]). The winner's side goes first.
##### What if one side has more people?
If there are more people left on one side after the other has exhausted all of their members, the remaining people can go consecutively.  
##### What if we can't decide who should go next on our side?
You are adults. Figure it out.
