Each creature has an action and bonus action, as well as a reaction, which all refresh at the start of your turn. Unlike 5e, movement is not free; instead, movement is one option for your bonus action.
### Bonus Actions
Bonus actions are mostly about moving yourself, or moving other people. If a Bonus Action allows you to move, you can spend some of the movement, use an action, then spend the rest of the movement.

You can spend your action to gain an additional bonus action on your turn. You can also spend `6` Stamina to gain an additional bonus action on your turn - you can do this only once per turn.

Listed in no particular order, these are bonus actions that all creatures have access to:
#### 🏃Move
Your character starts with a speed based on your ancestry, usually 40 feet. This represents the distance you can move using this Bonus Action. Movement is usually reduced based on the armor you’re wearing.

Moving to an immediately adjacent square costs 5 feet of movement. Moving to a diagonally adjacent square costs 5 feet of movement, then 10 feet of movement, repeating for alternating diagonals.

You **can** move through your allies. You **cannot** move through enemies without making an Agility-Acrobatics Test.

The total distance you willingly move with this Maneuver or any other effect that allows you to move, including any combination of climbing, swimming, jumping, and flying, can’t exceed your speed.
##### 🧗Climb / 🏊Swim 
As part of the **Move** bonus action, you can climb or swim. Each square you climb or swim costs 10 feet of movement instead of 5. If the surface is difficult to climb or the liquid is hard to swim in, the DM can call for a Athletics Check. On a failure, you can’t climb or swim but waste no movement in the attempt. Creatures with a climb speed can climb on vertical and horizontal surfaces at full speed without needing to make a Check. Creatures with a swim speed can swim in any liquid at full speed without needing to make a Check.

You can attempt to climb a creature whose Size is greater than yours. If the creature is willing, you can climb them without a Check. If the creature is unwilling, they make an Athletics or Acrobatics Check (their choice) opposed by your Athletics Check. On a success, you climb the creature. While you climb or ride a creature, you gain Advantage to Melee Attacks against the creature and the creature can use a Bonus Action to make a Athletics or Acrobatics Check (their choice) opposed by your Athletics Check. On a failure, you fall from the creature into an unoccupied adjacent space of their choice.
##### 🦘Jump 
As part of the **Move** bonus action, you can make a long jump and jump a number of squares equal to your Strength score without a Check. If you wish to jump further, make a DC 12 Athletics Check as part of this bonus action. On a success, you jump up to an extra 15 feet.

Also as a part of the **Move** bonus action, you can make a high jump and jump up 5 feet. If you want to jump up 10 feet, you must succeed on a DC 12 Athletics Check as part of this Bonus Action.
##### 🦅Fly
A creature with a fly speed can move through the air at full speed with the **Move** bonus action.
#### 🤸Disengage
Same as **Move**, but you only move up to half your speed, and *do not provoke opportunity attacks* for the movement.
#### 🤝Assist
When you use the Assist bonus action, an adjacent ally gains 1 Advantage to the next Attack or Check they make before the end of their next turn. Your hero has to be able to provide help in order for this bonus action to work. For instance, you could help another creature climb over a wall if you are close enough to provide a boost. However, it is far less likely that you can help a creature recall lore about necromancy rituals if you have no expertise on the subject. The DM has the final say in when an Assist can help another creature. A creature can only benefit from one Assist at a time.
#### 👎Hinder
When you use the Hinder bonus action, an adjacent enemy gains 1 Disadvantage to the next Attack or Check they make before the end of their next turn. You can typically Hinder another creature by distracting them from their task. Like an Assist, you can only Hinder another creature when it makes sense and the DM has final say in when a Hinder actually imposes Disadvantage.
#### 🤼Start a Grapple
As long as you have at least one arm or other grappling limb free, you can use this bonus action to attempt to grab a creature who is adjacent to you. Make an Athletics Check opposed by the target’s Athletics or Acrobatics Check (target’s choice). 

If you win, the target is Grappled by you. If you lose, the target can Knockback you a number of squares equal to their Might or Agility score (whichever they used to make the Test).

While grappling a target, you can only move at half speed (rounded down) and when you move, you bring the target with you.
#### 💪Break a Grapple
Use this bonus action when Grappled to make an Athletics or Acrobatics Check (your choice) opposed by an Athletics Check of the creature grappling you. If you succeed, you break the grapple, gain a benefit depending on the type of check you made:
* Athletics: you can Knockback the grappler a number of squares equal to your Strength bonus
* Acrobatics: you can immediately move a number of squares equal to your Dexterity bonus; this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
#### 🍹Drink Potion
Use this bonus action to drink a potion.
#### 🕵️Make a Check
Many [[Ability Checks]] are Bonus Actions in combat. Searching a chest with an Investigation Check, picking a door’s lock with an Slight of Hand Check, or lifting a portcullis with an Athletics Check would all be Bonus Actions.

Not all Checks in combat are Bonus Actions. Complex or time-consuming Checks might be an Action or take even longer, while some Checks that take no time at all, like an Religion/Arcana check to recall lore about mummies, are Free Actions. The DM has final say on this matter.
#### 🦵Stand Up
You can use the Stand Up bonus action to stand up if you are Prone. You can move up to half your speed as part of this Bonus Action.
#### 👇Topple
You can use this bonus action to attempt to knock an adjacent creature Prone. Make an Athletics Check opposed by the target’s Athletics or Acrobatics (target’s choice). If you win, the target falls Prone. If the target wins, **you** fall Prone.
#### 🙌Push
You can use the Push bonus action to [[Miscellaneous Rules#Knockback|Knockback]] an adjacent creature up to a 5 feet times your Strength score. As part of pushing the creature, you can move as as much distance as you push them, moving in the same direction as the target.
### Actions
Your Action is how you Attack and do other cool, impactful things that affect the battle.
#### ⚔️Attack
See Attacking for more information on this action.
#### 🛡️Defend
When you take the Defend Action, you gain a +3 bonus to all your Defenses until the start of your next turn.
#### 🩹Second Wind
You regain 1d10 + your level Stamina and can make a saving throw to end an effect. If you are **vulnerable** (your Stamina is 0), you regain *twice* that amount. 

You can use this action only once, and must complete a short rest to use it again.
