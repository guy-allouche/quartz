You have two resources that are depleted by taking damage, **Stamina** and **Health**.
#### Stamina
**Stamina** is a measure of your ability to continue defending yourself against serious injury. Damage to Stamina can be imagined as disorientation, exhaustion, bruises/cuts/scrapes, fear and despair, or any other condition that inhibits your ability to carry on in a fight. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, damage always reduces your Stamina before reducing your health.

When your Stamina is reduced to zero you are **vulnerable**. Being vulnerable means that attackers can damage your health directly, and some abilities can affect you that you might otherwise resist.

You recover all your Stamina on a short or long rest.
#### Health
**Health** is a measure of bodily integrity. Damage to health constitutes a serious wound. While your health is damaged, you have **Disadvantage** on Ability Checks for which you don't have a Skill Proficiency.

When your health is reduced to zero or lower by an attack (**your health can become negative**), you are immediately placed **On Death's Door** until your health becomes positive again.

Generally, health can only be recovered slowly via long rests, or via magical healing.
#### Death's Door
When important heroes and villains have their health reduced to zero or lower, they are placed **On Death's Door** instead of immediately dying. If you start your turn while **On Death's Door**, you must choose one of the following options:
* *You take it from here:* You fall unconscious, and are no longer **On Death's Door**. You will not wake up until you take a short rest, after which you awaken with 1 health.
* *I'm not done yet:* You can take your turn. At the end of your turn, if you are still **On Death's Door**, you die.
