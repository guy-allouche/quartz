In DnD 2, you have two resources that are depleted by taking damage, **Stamina** and **Health**.
#### Stamina
**Stamina** is a measure of your ability to continue defending yourself against serious injury. Damage to Stamina can be imagined as disorientation, exhaustion, bruises/cuts/scrapes, fear and despair, or any other condition that inhibits your ability to carry on in a fight. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, damage always reduces your Stamina before reducing your health.

When your Stamina is reduced to zero you are **vulnerable**. Being vulnerable means that attackers can damage your health directly, and some abilities can affect you that you might otherwise resist.

You recover all your Stamina on a short or long rest.
#### Health
**Health** is a measure of bodily integrity. Damage to health constitutes a serious wound - although, in heroic fashion, these wounds do not reduce your ability to fight unless stated otherwise. When your health is reduced to zero, you die.

Generally, health can only be recovered slowly via long rests, or via magical healing.
